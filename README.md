This repository is for ISQA3900 Activity 2. The purpose of this activity was to refresh my brain on how to write
HTML and CSS. 


The css folder contains the css style sheet. 

The pics folder contains the photos used in this activity. 

Violeta.html is the webpage homepage which contains some information about myself. It also includes some links that
take the webpage user to different websites. One website is created by me and the other is dance mat typing. 

GTO23.html is the second webpage that I created that displays some photos I captured during my trip to Guanajuato,
Mexico during the summer of 2023. 

The PDF file is the instructions for this assignment.
